                Hello everyone, My name is Windsake and the site is about Black desert online's 
                trading lifeskill.</li>
            <li>
                Obviously a lot of great sites exist already which i do not even dream of surpassing,
                the page is for information i felt like sharing or could not find elsewhere
                and had to look up myself in the game.
            </li>
            <li>I will also put out my methods on doing trading, which might not be what is the best,
                but it will surely be the most fun in my eyes.</li>

            <h3 >I'm playing on the EU region, my main server being Velia2.</h3>
            <li>If you are curious about my character skill level(currently</li>
                <li class="mastery_desc"> Master 8</li>
                <li>),you can take a look at my family sheet here:

                <li>I'm mostly doing <b>active trading</b> for xp, which i found very fast and you can
                research your next move while you are autopathing between the cities.</li>
                <li>It gives you a lot of xp based on the distance between the nodes you are trading with
                    (the distance is set, no matter how big of a detour you do)</li>
                <li>You can see the distance bonus of your chosen nodes if you look at <a href="https://www.somethinglovely.net/bdo/crates/">Famme's site
                </a>.</li>
                <li>You just pick a skill level(for the distance bonus, you can pick any), add a crate and the node selector will appear:</li>

                <li>Trade Managers restock their trade items about 30m-1h after you first "bought" their wares.
                    Exact time will be found out soon!
