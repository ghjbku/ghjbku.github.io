            <p>
                The site is about Black desert online's trading lifeskill.</p>
            <p>
                Obviously a lot of great sites exist already which i do not even dream of surpassing,
                this site is for sharing information that i could not find on the internet
                and had to look it up myself in the game.
            </p>
            <p>I will also put out my methods on doing trading, which might not be what is the best,
                but it will surely be the most fun in my eyes.</p>
